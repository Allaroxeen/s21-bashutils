The Hunting of the Snark is a nonsense poem by the English writer Lewis twCarroll, telling the story of ten characters who cross the ocean to hunt a mysterious creature known as the Snark. The poem was published in 1876 with illustrations by Henry Holiday. This is the seventh plate from his illustrations, accompanying "Fit the Fifth: The Beaver's Lesson", in which the Butcher and the Beaver hear the song of the Jubjub bird, and this causes the Butcher to be reminded of his childhood, and begin a lengthy lesson to the Beaver:

The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,twCarroll
And ink in unfailing supplies:tw
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,tw
And watched them with wondering eyes.tw
 tw
So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,tw
As he wrote with a pen in each hand,tw
And explained all the while in a popular styletw
Which the Beaver could well understand.tw
